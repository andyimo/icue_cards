- There is a device titling function for this game. I am trying start from that first, but i find that
 it need to include a lot of dependencies, and it is hard to test, so i decide to do it later.

-the code and the  widget of flutter are combined together, which makes me really confused with the code,
all the things can not display properly, there is very little process.

-Find that lerning while coding is difficult so i spend some time on learning the widget
