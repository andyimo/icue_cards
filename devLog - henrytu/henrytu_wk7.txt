Nov. 1
Week 7

- Complete the 3D card view page where a card can be presented as a real card. Tap to flip, swipe to discard. Also added a restart button and a make-random button, the restart button will bring every card back again, the random button will randomize the deck. Added stream so that a card can be swiped to the left to put to the back of the deck, swipe right to discard.

- Added two buttons on the app home page so the card part and the game part can be correctly navigated through

- Took the responsibility of merging everybody's code in to one whole app for the preparation of D2
