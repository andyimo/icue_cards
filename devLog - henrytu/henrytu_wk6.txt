October 25
Week 6

- After the reading week, I have fully completed the card list page where a card can be added, deleted, edited(change colour) and changed position . 

- Started on building the 3D card view page, where a card can be presented like a real card. It can be tapped to flip the card to see the other side, swiped away to discard it and see the next card.

- Encountered difficulty testing Andy's user login, the debug console gave tons of error messages and the page keeps loading.
