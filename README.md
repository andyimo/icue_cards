# icue_cards

A hastily put together project that we aim to get mostly done by this Friday, December 4th, 2020.
It's a cue card app in which students with two main components:
(1) a study component in which students who use the app will be able to create cue cards to better memorize material taught in class.
(2) a gaming component that features a Heads Up! and Kahoot! game that uses the cue cards the student has already created to play.
