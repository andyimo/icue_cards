                              WEEKLY DEV LOG 7
                       November 1 - November 7, 2020
      ------------------------------------------------------------------

 - Devoted this week to preparing for Deliverable 2 and doing last minute
   merging of our code.
 - Interviewed each team member to check in on the state of their individual
   parts of the app, what they still have left to do (to get a sense of what
   to write for the report):
    - Henry: Two ways to view a student's cue cards (list and deck view)
             Can edit cards, add cards, rearrange cards, delete cards, and
             change their colours.
    - David: A home page with dropdown lists that specify a cue card deck to
             play with, another dropdown with the number of cards to play with,
             a summary page with the score and a list of incorrect responses
             Tilting still not implemented.
    - Suki : Same as David
  - Wrote the D2 report.
  - Designing the client-server component diagram took almost 3 hours to learn
    how to do on visual-paradigm
