                              WEEKLY DEV LOG 2
                      September 27 - October 3, 2020
      ------------------------------------------------------------------

 - Watched Guillaume's gitHub tutorial
 - Unanimous decision to go ahead and use Flutter as our mobile framework
 - Practiced the basics of Dart (statically typed language, has variables, lists
   functions, classes, and objects)
 - Made all the necessary downloads (took me almost an entire day! :O )
     - Flutter
     - Android Studio
     - XCode
     - VSCode

 - During the weekly meeting, did a roundtable of what everyone accomplished
   over the week
 - Ran diagnostic tests on each team member's (flutter doctor -v)
 - Gave a quick lesson about the basics of Dart to the team over Zoom by
   sharing my screen
 - Two team members were not ready and did not have Flutter installed on
   their machines
 - Agenda for next week: Assess who is comfortable working on which components
   of the app and delegate portions of the workload to team members accordingly
