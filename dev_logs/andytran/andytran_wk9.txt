                              WEEKLY DEV LOG 9
                       November 15 - November 21, 2020
      ------------------------------------------------------------------

 - A large amount of my time this week has been spent working on the
   Deliverable 3 report
 - Had to catch up and watch the lectures to even begin understanding
   Architectural Styles and System Design Patterns (at least 6 hrs)
 - Found a fantastic resource explaining the Design Patterns in great detail
   which helpful examples: https://refactoring.guru/
 - Performed architectural recovery in an attempt to see which Design Patterns
   or architectural styles best fit what we currently had
      - The Student class I created which takes in a FirebaseUser.uid as a parameter
        is an example of the Facade Design Pattern
      - Suggested to the team that we could possibly make a super class called
        Game that the two games Kahoot! and HeadsUp! can inherit from since they
        share similar properties such as requiring a deck to play with, keeping
        a score, and showing one cue card after the next.
      - David suggested also making a summary/result class for this game superclass
      - This would be polymorphism/inheritance akin to what we find in the
        Factory Design Pattern (had to look that up in refactoring-guru website)
      - Designed the UML Class Diagram to incorporate into the report
  - Interviewed each team member about challenges they faced during the
    development of their specific components of the application, what they still
    have left to do, and anything they felt might have changed since we began. Asked
    each member to send over a small paragraph with what they've accomplished so far.

  - UPDATE: The deadline for the report has been extended to Monday at noon!
            Asked Henry to proof read, and Suki and David to write up their reasoning
            for 'choosing' the Factory method design pattern for their portion of
            the application. 
  - n.b. did not have time to work on a form of local storage or firebase storage
