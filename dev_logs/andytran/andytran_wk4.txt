                              WEEKLY DEV LOG 4
                       October 11 - October 17, 2020
      ------------------------------------------------------------------

 - Began conducting research on how to implement a login system in a Flutter
   application (https://pusher.com/tutorials/login-ui-flutter)

 - Learned about Firebase (potentially can use as a backend for our application),
   Shared Preferences (acts like a bookmark for our app)
 - Pitched Firebase to members of the team. One member was reluctant and hesitant
   about the use of this service as our backend.
     - Decided on hosting another meeting on Saturday to allow her and other
       team members some time to research which backend they would like to use
     - If no suggestions or alternatives are brought forward, Firebase will be
       our backend of choice.

  - UPDATE: No one researched any other alternatives so Firebase it is!
  - Found another very useful tutorial online (TheNetNinja)
  - Still very annoyed with how unusable my PC is (Late-2013 iMac) whenever
    I try to load Android Studio or run a phone emulator
