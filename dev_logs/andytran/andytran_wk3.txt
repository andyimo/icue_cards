                              WEEKLY DEV LOG 3
                        October 4 - October 10, 2020
      ------------------------------------------------------------------

 - Started to follow YouTube tutorials on how to program in Flutter.
 - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0uinJvhNxI&ab_channel=Academind
 - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ukSR1GRtMU&ab_channel=TheNetNinja
 - Began practicing by following along with TheNetNinja's tutorials in which
   he demonstrates how to code a simple application that shows timezones for
   different cities around the world
 - Very apprehensive about working with Widgets (complicated data structures)
 - Emulator takes almost an hour to load on my computer and Android Studio can
   take upwards to half an hour to finally boot up. My computer also becomes
   insanely slow while the Emulator or Android Studio are running making it
   impossible to do much else.
 - Might need to think about buying a new PC :T

 - Hosted this week's meeting over Discord rather than over Zoom (a team
   member was having audio and connection issues over Zoom)
 - Delegated tasks to other team members:
     me     -> Login and home page *
     Henry  -> Cue cards
     David  -> Heads Up!
     Suki   -> Kahoot!

 * Admittedly a small portion of the application.
   I'm happy because my computer is very slow anyways.
   Agreed to take charge of class presentations and writing the reports
   for any deliverables to compensate for lack of coding.
