                              WEEKLY DEV LOG 11
                       November 29 - December 5, 2020
      ------------------------------------------------------------------

 - DEVELOPER CRUNCH DEVELOPER CRUNCH DEVELOPER CRUNCH
 - Got a new Windows PC on which I can continue developing the app (rather than
   suffer using my old iMac that takes eons to load Android Studio and pull up
   the emulator)
 - Major problem after making the transition from Mac to Windows 10:
   The command 'flutter pub get' does not work. Surprisingly, the solution was to 
   uninstall McAffee Firewall which was interfering with this command trying to 
   access the flutter SDK.
 - Attempted to refactor my portion of the code after updating the dependencies
   in the pubspec.yaml file to their latest version so that my teammates in
   China might be able to access Firebase. Required a complete overhaul as
   parts of the codebase were broken and unusable.
 - Found this tutorial from only two months ago on how to handle Firebase
   authentication in a clean, efficient way:

 - Finally, my other teammates can login from their machines!
 - Finally sent the TA our gitHub link (whoops)
 - Major headache trying to implement a form of local storage and send data
   over to Firebase.
 - Stream (my weakness) would have to be set up so that any changes to a deck,
   cue card, or folder will be detected and sent over to Firebase. Integrating
   this would require adding this all throughout Henry's code which is a mountain
   too high for me to scale :(
 - Hard coded about 7 lectures worth of material as sample cue cards (for presentation 
   purposes)

 - Spent about two hours designing the login page, registration page, and home page 
   UI in Figma.
 - Drew inspiration from UI designs posted on www.behance.net and dribble.com  
 - www.fontawesome.com has some universally useful symbols 
 - undraw.co has free illustrations that look great! 
 - I've included the fruit of 2 hours of ui design labour in this directory.
 - Fortunately, it only took about an hour to bring this design into the app 
   I guess that goes to show how fast development is when you've got a plan 

 - Interviewed each teammate about their progress and wrote the report accordingly
   (About 2 hrs of interviewing and 2 hrs of report writing)
 - After Henry made screen recordings of the app on his physical device, he sent them
   over to me so I could create the YouTube video. This took about 3 hrs to get done.
   I create the video in iMovie and used rotato.xyz to get the 3D models of our app 
   running on a phone
