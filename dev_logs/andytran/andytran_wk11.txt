                              WEEKLY DEV LOG 11
                       November 29 - December 5, 2020
      ------------------------------------------------------------------

 - DEVELOPER CRUNCH DEVELOPER CRUNCH DEVELOPER CRUNCH
 - Got a new Windows PC on which I can continue developing the app (rather than
   suffer using my old iMac that takes eons to load Android Studio and pull up
   the emulator)
 - Major problem after making the transition from Mac to Windows 10:
   The command 'flutter pub get' does not work. The solution was to uninstall
   McAffee Firewall which was interfering with this command trying to access
   the flutter SDK.
 - Attempted to refactor my portion of the code after updating the dependencies
   in the pubspec.yaml file to their latest version so that my teammates in
   China might be able to access Firebase. Required a complete overhaul as
   parts of the codebase were broken and unusable.
 - On multiple occasions, login and registration stopped working completely
   especially when trying to implement a toggle between these two pages. 
 - Found this tutorial from only two months ago on how to handle Firebase
   authentication in a clean, efficient way:

 - Finally sent the TA our gitHub link (whoops)
 - Major headache trying to implement a form of local storage and send data
   over to Firebase.
 - Stream (my weakness) would have to be set up so that any changes to a deck,
   cue card, or folder will be detected and sent over to Firebase. Integrating
   this would require adding this all throughout Henry's code which is a mountain
   too high for me to scale :(

 - My focus will shift to improving the UI of the login, registration, and
   home page (for the presentation) as well as hardcoding some of the
   sample cue cards I've already made so that the application can still serve
   as a study tool for 3004.

 - To do: Write the final report for Deliverable 4
          Learn to get the app up and running on my physical device (iPhone)
          Practice for the presentation next week
          Making the YouTube video has been delegated over to Henry (thankfully)
