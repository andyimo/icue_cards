                              WEEKLY DEV LOG 5
                       October 18 - October 24, 2020
      ------------------------------------------------------------------

 - Firebase setup on the console.firebase.google.com website
 - Basic modules created for the login, register, and home pages
 - Login and Register currently are identical (but one says Register and the
   other says Login)
 - Home page is currently empty
 - Updated pubspec.yaml file to include dependencies relevant to Firebase.
   Major difficulties encountered and many headaches self-inflicted in doing this.
   The commands and properties for certain Firebase objects such as FirebaseUser
   are either unavailable or deprecated for different versions of firebase_core
   and firebase_auth specified in the pubspec.yaml file.
   e.g. Firestore.instance.collection() does not work for newer versions of
        firestore! Instead, the object is actually a FirebaseFirestore object (
        not a Firestore object) which has an update() method rather than the
        Firestore's setData() method.

 - Also having difficulty understand the Provider class necessary for user login
   Streams are not a concept I'm very familiar with at all
 - Not a very productive week for me at all encountering setback after setback
