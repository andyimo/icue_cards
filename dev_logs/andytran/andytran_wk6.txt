                              WEEKLY DEV LOG 6
                       October 25 - October 31, 2020
      ------------------------------------------------------------------

 - Pleased to report that I finally have a fully functional login, logout,
   and registration system Ã  la Firebase
 - Able to toggle between the registration and login pages via a flatButton in the
   top right corner
 - When registering, users are expected to enter in passwords that are at least
   6 characters long; the app will refuse input that is not of an appropriate length
 - Passwords are obscured as the user types them in
 - Having some difficulty making sure the user enters a valid email address.
 - The program will get stuck/crash if the user enters in an invalid one.
   In the meantime, a 'ghetto' regular expression has been included to try to
   check against the email the user types before it gets sent off to Firebase to
   be authenticated. Will be improved next week (hopefully).

 - During this weeks team meeting, I learned that the team has not been using
   the gitHub repository to commit their work.
 - The other team members are not able to access Firebase even though it runs
   smoothly on my machine. Possibly having something to do with the fact that
   they're in China???
 - Spent the bulk of the reading week, along with Henry, attempting to merge
   everyone's code together and making sure it runs on my machine
 - Problem: the Provider stream I've set up seems to conflict with navigation
            between the other pages of the app. I'm unable to log out of the
            application any more.
            Will have to see how to make the routes Henry has set up work
            alongside the Provider stream that dictates whether a user should
            be logged in or out.
