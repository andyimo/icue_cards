 - Prepared an agenda for today's team meeting (10AM - 11AM):
    1. Team reflection on the proposals presented Monday, September, 21, 2020.
       Discussed the ideas we were most impressed with and what we could learn
       from them. Took a bit of time to talk about how we believe our
       presentation went and where we could improve for the next one.
    2. Motioned to make ICUE CARDS available on both iOS and Android. Our app
       should be created so that all of our fellow classmates, whether they be
       an Android or iOS user, should have access to it.
    3. Introduced Flutter to the team: a mobile UI framework for creating native
       apps for iOS and Android. Also introduced Firebase. These suggestions
       were met with some pushback from the team as some were hesitant about
       learning a new language (Dart).
