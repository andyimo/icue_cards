                              WEEKLY DEV LOG 8
                       November 8 - November 14, 2020
      ------------------------------------------------------------------

 - Fully merged copy of the code committed to GitHub at last.
 - As my part is pretty much complete aside from some UI improvements, focused
   time on reviewing the lectures and make cue cards to incorporate into our
   mobile application.
 - Created sample cue cards for lecture 3 Requirements Engineering
                                lecture 4 Use Cases
                                lecture 5 User Stories
                                lecture 6 Domain Models

 - UPDATE: Will be implementing a form of local storage (as suggested by Henry)
           as well as making firebase capable to storing user data (probably
           will store a directory of cue cards)
