Weekly Dev Log 11
November 29 - December 5, 2020

-Almost finish the whole project! Use the github desktop version to do some last minute version
control
-From the begining, i did not implement the device titling and use two button instead, i think it is the last minte work,
it should be done although it is very difficult. 
-Doing some research and adding the the sensor event listener into the code, but also keep that two floating
button as i still can not load the project on a real device so i can not test. So i keep these two both, in case sensor can 
not work.
-Add a timer to the heads up game, when the player run out of the time and did not make the answer,
it will be treated as a wrong answer.
-Improve the review page again, make it as a flip card, which can show front and back by clicking, also make sure all
the text within the limited range can be shown completely on the page.
-Test the bug in the select folder page by white boxing testing method, and successfully find the bug and fix that.
