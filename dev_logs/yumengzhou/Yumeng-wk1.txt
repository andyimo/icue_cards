Weekly Dev Log 1
September 20 - 26, 2020

-make a mock which is the UI for our project
    -including the home page, deck view, card view and the home page of the game page
 this mock up also partly included in the report of D1
- In order to make this low fidelity, we need to have a clearly understanding of the function
of the iCueCard project
- have a discussion on choosing which language/frame for the project
  for me i currently not in favour of using flutter
- decide to hold a weekly meeting every Tuesday
- at first, i would like to use java as we are more familiar with that and that could be used in Andriod develop
 So, after the meeting, I spend some time to search information on Dart.
