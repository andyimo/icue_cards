-parepare for the oral presentation
-for my individual part, as I spent a lot of time on my little local branch, after the latest merge, i found that my dart sdk version
is too low to handle my team members' work, so i make an upgrade of sdk version, take some time.
-checking with Henry about the root of the project, as i do the hardcode for the drop down list iteam. Also, i found that instead 
of choosing the deck directly, i need to read from the folder first, and i can no longer use my original way to pass the parameter as
the root is not look like what i thinking before, make a lot of change of that.
-For testing purpose, i hardcode some root, folder and deck objects, and make sure that can be loaded dynamiclly into the drop down list, 
also the value in the drop down can be properly get and sent to the next page.
