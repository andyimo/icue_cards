WEEKLY LOG Week 11
November 29 - December 5, 2020

-a lot of time was spent upgrading the SDK due to the 
unsupported versions of the Flutter SDK and Dart SDK, 
because some functions required an external package. 
After the upgrade was completed, it was not able to 
function properly for some unknown reason. This has 
led me to nothing special in this week.
-prepared the D4
